# This is an example yaml configuration for the archiving of a digitised rock/handsample.
# Please copy it and place it next to the source data prior to filling in the metadata.
# The name is automatically generated. As part of the process the configuration settings
# and image itself is stored on the Svalbox file-server in the following format:

# //gis/Svalbox-DB/IMG360-DB
# / ---- 2020
# / -------- 2020-0001
# / ------------ img360_2020-0001.{extension}
# / ------------ generation_settings.yml
# / -------- 2020-0002
# / ------------ img360_2020-0002.{extension}
# / ------------ generation_settings.yml
# / ...
# / -------- 2020-9999
# / ------------ img360_2020-9999.{extension}
# / ------------ generation_settings.yml

##### OBS! #####
# If multiple entries are to be covered, use a "list" setup:
#
# image_owner: #
#    - Peter Betlem
#    - Kim Senger
#
# versus (when a single item is desired)
#
# image_owner: Tom Birchall
